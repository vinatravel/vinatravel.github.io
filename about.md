Hi, I’m Khang !

I’m a Computer Science student who lives in SF. When I was a kid, I always believe in the endless possibilities technology can bring to humanity. I think technology is closest to magic and people who excel in innovating and expanding it are great wizards of our time. I'm trying my best to become one myself, that is my dream. There are times when I doubted myself, but then I realized nobody is born with super power, it takes them hard works to get where they are, the only way to evolve is to keep moving up. I'm still at an early stage on the journey to become a tech wizard, I don't know what challenges are waiting for me but one thing I know for sure, that I'm in the right place.
